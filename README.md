### The challenge
 Users should be able to:
 Watch the different display depending on the size of the device (mobile or desktop) and the change of the color and image in some items when someone hover the mouse over them.

### My process
First we organized the HTML structure for the mobile design and we added the layouts including the hover selector on the image, title and author's name. Then, we put a @media to change the size of the component for a better display on the desktop design.


### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned
- Hover pseudo class to make changes when you mouse over them.

- display none to hide an element.


#### Example 1
```
 span {
    color: white;
}

span:hover {
    color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}

```

#### Example 2
```
#view {
    display: none;
}

#equilibrium:hover + #view {
    display: block;
}

#equilibrium:hover{
    filter: opacity(0.6) drop-shadow(0 0 0 hsl(178, 100%, 50%));
}

```
